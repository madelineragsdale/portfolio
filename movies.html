			<p>Since the Lumière Brothers projected some of the first flickering images upon a screen, movies have occupied a vastly important place in American culture. The watching of a film remains both a collective and individual experience, although the ways in which one watches a movie has mutated and grown since their conception. Throughout the years, movies have been played through magic lanterns, through nickelodeons, inside opulent theatres and from rolls of tape or discs of plastic.  Now, in the twenty-first century, online movie streaming services are becoming increasingly popular, changing the way people understand and experience a film, for better and for worse. 
Magic lantern shows at the turn of the century began the phenomenon of movie theatres. People crowded into theatres to watch a parade of pictures projected on a screen, narrated and set to music (2). Such as with the modern movie theatres of today, people were able to stop and see a show at their leisure. The Lumière Brother’s Sortie de l’usine Lumière de Lyon, considered the first film, began the wave of silent films, which soon overtook the world (3). Nickelodeons began cropping up throughout America’s storefronts, where viewers could pay a small sum to watch a short movie. As silent films grew into a worldwide phenomenon, movie theatres found their way into the landscape of American culture. Keeping in touch with glamour and opulence of the 1920s, movie palaces – large, opulent theaters – were built by the hundreds. These movie palaces contained large screens and seats with pivoted backs, setting the standard for all movie theatres to come (1).
The introduction of VHS tapes in the late 1970s started shifting the way the American public consumed movies. Movies were now more ‘on-demand’ than ever before. Instead of waiting for a movie to play at a theatre or on television, viewers could rent a VHS tape and watch the film any time they liked, as many times as they liked. A whole library of movies was now at the viewer’s disposal, giving them the option to watch movies they may have missed in theatres, or movies they might have never heard of (5). The movie rental business shifted from VHS tapes to DVDs before dying out all together with the introduction of online streaming services. Netflix and Amazon Video soon dominated the game, offering a wide variety of movies to their subscribers at the press of a digital button. People no longer had to leave their house for either a theatre or a Blockbuster to watch a movie. They had them all right at their fingertips (6).
The introduction of streaming services to movie culture has certainly changed the way Americans view films, in both positive and negative ways. Seen through an optimistic lens, streaming services have done quite a bit of good for the consumption of film. With a streaming service, the viewer is exposed to hundreds of movies they might never have heard of without. They are given the opportunity to delve into different genres, directors, and styles without the pressure or commitment of paying for a movie ticket or VHS rental. Instead, they pay a flat price for the freedom to watch as many movies as the service offers. Perhaps someone hates horror movies, and refuses to see them theatres. With a streaming service, they can tentatively try out this new genre in the comfort of their own home and perhaps discover a new interest. Also available are older or more esoteric movies, ones you can no longer watch in theatres or on television. Those who love cinema can watch the history of film pass before their eyes with streaming services, watching and learning about the classics. Directors such as David Lynch and cult-classic movies like Heathers or Clueless experienced a re-ignition of popularity in the young people of today. Indie cinema also benefits from streaming services. Netflix devotes an entire section to independent cinema, giving small-time directions and low-budget studios more of a chance for recognition and consumption. 
However, although streaming services have many positive effects on the twenty-first century’s film-watching experience, it bears some negative effects as well. The average viewer’s attention span has shortened considerably. With so many movies at their disposal, turning off a film at the slightest sensation of boredom has become the norm, turning into an endless cycle of watching a little bit of a film, getting tired of it, finding a new one and starting the process all over again. Movies lose their meaning when viewed like this, in constant competition with each other. Also lost is the Movie Theatre Experience. Although ticket sales for theatres still skyrocket to this day, watching a movie on a laptop or a cellphone has become the norm. People watch movies in bed, on the subway, in the bath: anywhere. Smart phones and laptops made films portable, but they lost the magic of the movie theatre, the community shared between the members of the audience in the darkness. The old-Hollywood beauty of Singin’ in the Rain conveys itself differently through the blue-tinged LED light of a laptop than it does projected on a 50-foot-tall screen. Something subtle is lost in the translation between silver screen and hand-held screen, something not so easily defined. 
Although the way in which America views their movies is changing both positively and negatively, movies still remain integral to our modern-day culture. Streaming services have both positive and negative effects on the way a viewer experiences films and film culture. And yet, even as these streaming services grow more and more popular, going to the movie theatre remains an important and prominent American past time, something which will hopefully never change.
