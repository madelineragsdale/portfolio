			<p>Cross-legged on the floor of their Drexel dorm room, Alexandra Gordon unwinds the heavy braid of long brown hair falling down their back, twining their fingers through the strands. The sun, slowly setting through the choppy skyline of Philadelphia, paints the room gold, soaking Alexandra and their boyfriend, Brad, with buttery light. A rising player in Philadelphia’s DIY basement music scene, Alexandra, 19, has been making music since their sophomore year of high school, slowly but surely evolving into the fresh, experimental musician they are today. With over thirty original songs and eight albums under their belt already, not to mention a slew of covers and singles, Alexandra continually mutates and cultivates their distinct sound. They currently play under the alliterative moniker Borzoi Boy, accompanied by drums and backing guitar. In the sinking glow of a winter sunset, Alexandra talks about their progression into making music, their queer identity, and their place within the underground of Philadelphia’s music scene. 

Alexandra started playing music at age four, taking classical piano lessons. They continued with piano until age 15, when they decided they they needed to do something different, and subsequently purchased their first string instrument: a crappy guitar. The crappy guitar morphed into a ukulele, which was then traded in for a Fender. Alexandra first began recording music with their ukulele in the winter of 2015, after a nasty breakup. “I knew two chords, C and G, and I was like, ‘How can I finesse this?’” Their first heartbreak spurred their first mini album, composed of the short, glittery songs they would eventually find themselves known for. They created a bandcamp under their full name and began releasing music, starting with the sparse, ukulele picking of Lava Lamp, a song clocking in at 34 seconds long. Their first album, titled ‘Over EP’ consists of three original songs (all under 45 seconds), and one cover of local Philadelphia band Radiator Hospital, whose music still inspires Alexandra to this day. Alexandra would record their songs directly into the Voice Memos app on their phone, then upload the recordings to their Bandcamp. “After I released my first little album, I thought, ‘I can do something with this!,’ and all my friends were like ‘MAKE MUSIC!’” 
For their seventeenth birthday, Alexandra bought themselves a yellow Fender guitar and named it Diane, after the anonymous woman behind Dale Cooper’s tape recorder in Twin Peaks. “I only bought it ‘cus it was yellow,” Alexandra says, “but it ended up kinda being like my child.” They purchased an interface, a synth, a drum machine,  and some “real recording equipment” to record their songs through Garageband. “I really liked the songs I was writing,” they said, “I had a good amount of stuff to write about.”  After a few singles and covers, Alexandra put out their second album in December of 2015, titled pretty. pretty solidified Alexandra’s bedroom-pop style, characterized by simple chord progressions, floaty vocals and visual, poetic lyrics. In collaboration with local label L-Cat Records, Alexandra put out 25 cassette tapes of pretty, and sold them through their Bandcamp page. pretty was followed by Rain Songs in June 2016, a collection of short songs written about falling in love in high school. After Rain Songs came Dream Protocols in November 2015, unfinished because, in Alexandra’s words, “it was bad. It was just bad.” Guest House EP was the last album Alexandra put out under their own name, in June of 2017. Guest House consisted of just four songs, all under two minutes. Its Bandcamp description reads “sometimes my body feels like a rental house and thats ok.” The album is dedicated to “madeline, lake harmony, thea von harbou, coffee vending machines, getting older, sitting in empty parking lots, pocket guides.”

Alexandragordon.bandcamp.com was an ode to high school, a sort of musical diary of teenagehoodom . The music conjured up images of a blue-lit suburbia, Virgin Suicides-esque and haunting, populated by the ghosts of the teenaged misunderstood. But Alexandra was growing older, and with their graduation from high school and transition to college, their music began to transition as well. Borzoi Boy was born out of Alexandra’s desire to progress their music, and move from one era to a newer, fresher one. “I wanted to engage myself in an identity that’s not just me.” Once in college, Alexandra could finally participate in Philadelphia’s music scene. They decided to form a band around their sound, with the help of drummer Adam and guitarist Vinny. The name “Borzoi Boy” was inspired by the breed of Russian hounds. “Borzois are weird looking witch dogs,” Alexandra says. “Just like me. You’re not sure if you’re afraid of them, or if you love them, and that’s how I’m trying to be.” The move away from the singularity of Alexandra Gordon into the collective Borzoi Boy was a conscious one: “I can have other people in the band without them feeling like its Alexandra and the Gordons.” Even though Borzoi Boy is more a collaborative project, Alexandra still maintains creative control. They still come up with all the words and tunes, although their band members sometimes contribute. Borzoi Boy’s first album out was a split with other local DIY band Lotus Powers. After that, Borzoi Boy moved into their first solo album, titled enter light. Made up of five songs characteristically under two minutes long, enter light maintains Alexandra’s ghostly vocals and ambient guitar sounds. Bad at Math, released in December of 2017, exhibits Borzoi Boy’s first jump into use of a drummer. The sound is fuller and more complicated, although still absolutely Alexandra’s. Their voice, as soft and ethereal as one from a dream, floats over quiet drum beats and simple piano patterns, singing of the complications of gender, the still-constant ache of old heartbreak, and the changing dynamic of Alexandra’s new life. 
Lyrics play a big role in Alexandra’s music. “I usually come up with little snippets of things and write them down in the notes on my phone,” they say of their songwriting process. “I probably have sixty or seventy notes on my phone with just one little line, and I’ll eventually compile them onto notes on my computer and chop ‘em around until they look like a poem, almost, and then I’ll write some kind of chord progression on my synth or guitar.” Alexandra’s songs are visual, and thick with emotion: “I picture things in color.” 
Soon after putting Borzoi Boy together, the band joined Naptime Records, a student-run Philly label. Naptime Records manages four other bands in addition to Borzoi Boy. They put the bands they manage on Spotify with no costs to the artists, and get the musicians into Drexel’s recording studios to put together albums.  Although Alexandra appreciates these things, the communion has not been without its difficulties. Naptime Records is close to infringing on Alexandra’s grasp of creative control over their music, asking them to play specific shows or put out records on a deadline. Despite this, Alexandra stays true to their own vision: “I’m still booking all my shows, I’m still making all my merch, I’m still designing my own website.”  Of Naptime Records, Alexandra says, “They have a very set list of standards of how they wanna run this thing. They want an eclectic sound, but the guys running it are a bunch of white dudes. That’s where I take a huge issue, ‘cus I don’t want to be apart of that. But they’re my only hookup for studio time and Spotify.” As an outspoken member of the queer community, Alexandra makes it clear that they want to deviate from the straight, white, male domination of Philadelphia’s scene. 

Playing shows in the interconnected underground community of DIY music has long been a goal of Alexandra’s. Philadelphia is home to a thriving ‘Do-it-Yourself’ music scene composed mostly of young musicians under thirty. Local and touring bands play in the basements, backyards, and living rooms of houses posing as venues, christened with names along the likes of “Hole Foods,” “The Goo Lagoon,” and “The Inconvenience Store.” The shows are often illegal, smelling of cigarettes and weed, populated by a inebriated hoard of beer-toting teenagers and twenty-somethings in thrift-store clothing. You can pay anywhere between $3 and $10 to join the crowd, and drunkenly mosh in a Christmas light-lit basement to the distinctive, poppy sound of Philadelphia.  Borzoi Boy plays most of their shows in West Philly, around the Drexel Campus. North Philly shows, near Philadelphia’s other main college, Temple, are too far for Alexandra’s friends to make the trek to watch them play, and often more male-dominated. “White dudes in their little bands, I hate that,” Alexandra says. In order to find shows, Alexandra made connections. “In the beginning of the year I just went to as many shows as possible, and met the people who run the houses.” They’d message house owners on Facebook, asking if they needed any openers for show lineups. They created a Tinder account exclusively for finding people in the scene, putting “ONLY TALK TO ME ABOUT MUSIC AND BOOKING SHOWS” in their profile bio. Even so, Alexandra “doesn’t take the scene seriously at all.” They simply want to play for the love of playing. 
Borzoi Boy started playing their first shows in the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year. Performing live continues to be difficult for Alexandra, whose nerves often take over. They prefer playing with their band, though: “Playing solo always makes me so much more nervous, when everyone’s eyes are one. I get nervous after one or two songs, seeing the crowd’s reactions, whether the reactions are bad or good.” They’ve had both good and bad experiences playing the underground circuit. One particularly bad show, organized by a sketchy booker, consisted of a lineup of white men - not out of the ordinary for a Philadelphia show. “It was kind of a scary show,” Alexandra says, as Brad nods in agreement. “No one would help me with anything.” The other performers refused to help Borzoi Boy set up, instead leaving them ill-equipped to play their set. As the band played, the house owners left the lights on, unusual for a show, casting Borzoi Boy in “stark, horrible, fluorescent lighting.”
The next night, Borzoi Boy played one of their best shows, at the Goo Lagoon. Borzoi Boy was invited to play by the second guitarist from Whine Moms, a prominent DIY band, and by Banshee productions, a queer-centered booking group. Alexandra played with bandmates Vinny and Adam, performing around 7 songs. At the end, Alexandra played a song by themselves. “You couldn’t hear anything in the room while I played. It was like everyone stopped breathing. It was the most surreal thing ever. No one spoke. You literally could not hear anything other than me. Everyone just lost their shit afterwards.” Brad chimes in to say, “You really captured the room. You have such a presence. It was powerful.” 

Alexandra’s identity as a queer individual bears great influence on their music. They take a huge amount of inspiration from other queer performers, not so much in their style, but in the way they express their queer identity through music. “I feel like the words I write are really important. My songs aren’t necessarily all about being queer, but everything I’m experiencing can be experienced through a queer lens.” Alexandra wants to play more songs in queer spaces, where minorities are given more of a platform. “I’m playing a show soon in a storefront that’s supposed to be, like, an arts and community space, where they want to hear everyone’s voices. A lot of the people I make an effort to interact with in the scene are in the political sphere I want to be in. ” Even the name ‘Borzoi Boy’ connects back to their identity as a queer person. “I chose ‘Boy’ ‘cus I wanna scare people with my queerness. They’re expecting a boy, and I’m not one.” 

As for the future, Alexandra wants to keep playing shows and developing their sound for their love of music, not for fame or notoriety. “I’m just playing in college to have fun,” they say. “I really don’t take this shit too seriously.” They want to record more music and add more members to Borzoi Boy. “I wanna see where the band goes organically, but I still have the control that if I don’t like where something’s going I can change it.” They don’t plan on putting themselves into boxes or changing the way they make music for their label or for anyone else. “Let me have my fun,” Alexandra says. “That’s what I’m here for.”
