          <p>Cross-legged on the floor of their Drexel dorm room, Alexandra Gordon unwinds the heavy braid of long brown hair falling down their back, twining their fingers through the strands. The sun, slowly setting through the choppy skyline of Philadelphia, paints the room gold, soaking Alexandra and their boyfriend, Brad, with buttery light. A rising player in Philadelphia’s DIY basement music scene, Alexandra, 19, has been making music since their sophomore year of high school, slowly but surely evolving into the fresh, experimental musician they are today.  </p>

          Lower East Side’s Community Board 3 meeting on Tuesday, February 27th was dominated by flyers proclaiming: “Tech Hub MUST include zoning protections.” In the packed auditorium of PS 20 on Essex Street, scores of people raised their flyers high into the air, demanding new zoning protections in the Village before the construction of a Tech Hub on 14th street and 3rd avenue. Local residents of the Village are demanding these protections for the area in hopes of keeping the historic neighborhood from transforming into a sky-rise clogged ‘Silicon Alley.’

        <div class="card-content">
          <p> On March 9th, the street outside 164 Orchard street played host to a large assortment of colorfully dressed teenagers, young adults, and parents as they waited to enter the Sonder II Exhibit. Held inside a tiny storefront on the Lower East Side, Sonder welcomed its guests with a pink neon sign bearing the name of the exhibit in the window, glowing warmly in the freezing night. A collective put together by and for teenagers, the Sonder Collective gives young adults living in and around New York City a chance to show their work free of judgement, in a constructive and supportive gallery space open to all. 
          Inside the exhibit, artists and their supporters packed in shoulder to shoulder inside the tiny storefront to enjoy all the Sonder Collective had to offer.

         Inanna and Dumuzi’s relationship revolves around Inanna’s womanhood, and the power she derives from it. Inanna’s power is congruent to her femininity, while her femininity is tightly entwined with her sexuality. In order to activate her power, Inanna drapes herself in symbols of womanhood: she anoints her body with essential oils, then dons jewels, makeup, and dresses. She becomes the ultimate representation of woman, a holy courtesan, and thus one of the most powerful Gods in the Sumerian Pantheon. She bears no shame for her adamant femaleness, nor do others shame her for it.

          <p> 
        Since the Lumière Brothers projected some of the first flickering images upon a screen, movies have occupied a vastly important place in American culture. The watching of a film remains both a collective and individual experience, although the ways in which one watches a movie has mutated and grown since their conception. Throughout the years, movies have been played through magic lanterns, through nickelodeons, inside opulent theatres and from rolls of tape or discs of plastic.  Now, in the twenty-first century, online movie streaming services are becoming increasingly popular, changing the way people understand and experience a film, for better and for worse.

        <div class="card-content">
          <p> 
       She Rises Like the Sun: Invocations of the Goddess by Contemporary American Poets, first published in 1989, represents the female voice in modern-day polytheistic religion. Comprised of over one hundred poems by twenty-nine female poets, She Rises Like the Sun worships the vast concept of the Goddess through the written word. It is a reclamation of the female voice; a way to celebrate a feminine deity of the poet’s own creation, unencumbered by the patriarchy of male-dominated religion. This Goddess-centric poetry offers women an individualized, internal bridge with which to communicate with their own self-created holy being.
