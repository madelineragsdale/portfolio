			<p>Lower East Side’s Community Board 3 meeting on Tuesday, February 27th was dominated by flyers proclaiming: “Tech Hub MUST include zoning protections.” In the packed auditorium of PS 20 on Essex Street, scores of people raised their flyers high into the air, demanding new zoning protections in the Village before the construction of a Tech Hub on 14th street and 3rd avenue. Local residents of the Village are demanding these protections for the area in hopes of keeping the historic neighborhood from transforming into a sky-rise clogged ‘Silicon Alley.’
The site of the proposed Tech Hub on 14th street is currently zoned as a residential site. In order to build the Tech Hub, Mayor De Blasio proposed a rezoning of the area into a commercial zone, meaning commercial properties rather than residential ones would use the space. The Tech Hub would require demolishing the building currently occupying the land as well as huge amounts of construction. Local Village residents fear this rezoning will open up the floodgates to even more commercialization of the area. Smaller buildings and historic walk-ups have already been demolished for skyscrapers, such as the Moxy Hotel and the high-rise NYU dorms on 14th street, a trend many East Village inhabitants are desperate to stunt. They worry the Village may soon transform into something akin to Midtown South, the so-called ‘Silicon Alley’ of New York City.
Responsible for the distribution of flyers is the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation. Andrew Berman, executive director of the organization, spoke ,to much applause, during the public session segment of the community meeting. He implored Community Board 3 to support the zoning protections in the upcoming neighborhood wide vote, to “preserve the character of the Village, and prevent small businesses and walk-up apartments from turning into skyscrapers, fancy restaurants, and bars.” The Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation’s mission, as defined on their website, is to protect “the sense of place and human scale that define the Village’s unique community.” The organization has helped secure zoning protections for nearly 100 blocks and is currently advocating for the protection of 14th street and 3rd avenue.  
Harry Bubbins, the East Village and Special Projects Director at the GVSHP, commented on the Tech Hub: “Its construction will open up the real estate floodgates to this part of town, as the Silicon Alley or Bitcoin South.”  The GVSHP and their supporters want to protect the area surrounding the Tech Hub base, and mitigate the onslaught of prospective developers soon to hit after the Tech Hub’s construction. Harry feels that landlord developers such as the Tech Hub or NYU have had a negative on the Village. “They’ve certainly changed the character of the neighborhood,” he said, “for worse.” Julie Sisokovic, a resident of the Village since the 1980s, has also witnessed the transformation of the neighborhood. She also noted the increase of tech companies in the Village, with the construction of the Google building on 8th Avenue. However, she doesn’t find this increase of tech companies, dorms, and newer buildings to be such a negative thing: “There’s a lot more families and kids than there were 20 years ago, due to the safety of the city and improvements to the neighborhood.” 
The residents of the Village are not against the construction of the Tech Hub. Rather, they support the Hub’s mission of training low-income peoples in minorities in science, technology, engineering, and math fields, offering them the skills to pursue high-level jobs. At the community meeting, Brittany Spatz, a member of the Educational Alliance in downtown Manhattan,  spoke about the Tech Hub’s potential to give low-income people access to important job resources and “break the cycle of poverty” prevalent in housing projects. She brought a special guest to the community meeting: a young high schooler from low-income housing named Kiara, who said that the Tech Hub would allow her to explore different career options before going to college. 
The Greenwich Village Society for Historical Prevention efforts have not been in vain. Recently, Community Board 3 voted in support of zoning restrictions for 14th street and 3rd avenue. The Tech Hub will be built, giving low-income residents the opportunity to learn about STEM, and the East Village will move one step further away from becoming a Silicon Alley.
