			<p>Inanna and Dumuzi’s relationship revolves around Inanna’s womanhood, and the power she derives from it. Inanna’s power is congruent to her femininity, while her femininity is tightly entwined with her sexuality. In order to activate her power, Inanna drapes herself in symbols of womanhood: she anoints her body with essential oils, then dons jewels, makeup, and dresses. She becomes the ultimate representation of woman, a holy courtesan, and thus one of the most powerful Gods in the Sumerian Pantheon. She bears no shame for her adamant femaleness, nor do others shame her for it. Dumuzi accepts and celebrates his wife’s femininity, and their sexual relationship is based more or less around him providing her pleasure. Their relationship is female-driven and female-defined. Dumuzi is often identified as “the husband of Inanna”, while Inanna bears such lofty titles as “The Holy Priestess of Heaven” or “The First Daughter of the Moon”, never “the wife of Dumuzi.” However, although Inanna holds more power than Dumuzi, their relationship is still based on mutual respect and consent. 
The relationship between Hades and Persephone, interpreted in one manner, seems starkly opposite to that of Inanna and Dumuzi. Instead of Persephone’s womanhood leading her to power, it leads her to death in the “misty darkness.” Persephone represents maidenhood and purity, a contrast to Inanna’s status as ancient enchantress. Her transition out of her maidenhood leads her to the depths of the underworld, into a marriage devoid of love and respect. The sexual relationship between Persephone and Hades is characterized by possession rather than consent, and based around the desires of Hades rather than those of Persephone. He tricks her into eating pomegranate seeds, a metaphor for the beginning of the couple’s sexual relationship, often interpreted as the rape of Persephone. Persephone’s consumption of the pomegranate seeds solidifies Hades’s ownership over her, trapping her beneath the earth for a third of the year. In this sense, Persephone’s submissive sexuality is opposite to Inanna’s dominant one. Conversely, when viewing the story of Persephone and Hades through a different lens, Persephone possess more agency than previously given credit for. Perhaps she understood the truth of the pomegranate seeds, and by beginning a consensual sexual relationship with Hades and transitioning into womanhood, she finds her power, finally becoming Queen of the Underworld.  
Themes of power and womanhood interlace throughout these two stories of wives and their husbands. Their prescience speaks to a larger truth about how men and women interact with each other, in both sexual and social contexts. Womanhood can be terrifying to both women and men alike, especially when the woman in question exhibits control of her sexuality. A woman who finds no shame in femininity and sexuality is often a powerful one.
