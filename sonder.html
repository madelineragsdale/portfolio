			<p>On March 9th, the street outside 164 Orchard street played host to a large assortment of colorfully dressed teenagers, young adults, and parents as they waited to enter the Sonder II Exhibit. Held inside a tiny storefront on the Lower East Side, Sonder welcomed its guests with a pink neon sign bearing the name of the exhibit in the window, glowing warmly in the freezing night. A collective put together by and for teenagers, the Sonder Collective gives young adults living in and around New York City a chance to show their work free of judgement, in a constructive and supportive gallery space open to all. 
Inside the exhibit, artists and their supporters packed in shoulder to shoulder inside the tiny storefront to enjoy all the Sonder Collective had to offer. Photographs, paintings, drawings, prints and even poems dominated the white walls of the room, offering a look into the minds of New York City’s up-and-coming players in the art scene. Viewers and artists alike moved around the teeming room, admiring the work of themselves and their peers. Disposable cameras labeled with ‘Sonder’ stickers were at full disposable, and throughout the night passed back and forth between friends and strangers, capturing the room through the visitors eyes. A thesis statement pinned on the wall read: “In today’s world, more and more people are exposed to never before seen mediums in which they may express themselves, however, their work, more-often-than-not, goes under appreciated due to the inherent ageism prominent in the art world today. Through this exhibition, we ultimately hope to abolish the notion that artistry has an age range.” 
Sonder found its young artists through social media use, namely Instagram. Taylor Pedos, 19, a New School Student who displayed work at the exhibit, submitted to Sonder after stumbling upon their Instagram while scrolling through her feed. “I follow a bunch of small, teen-run galleries,” she said. “There’s a bunch in and outside New York. I’ve submitted to a lot of them. Most galleries like this make themselves known through Instagram.” 
Pedos told Elliot Bohlen, 19, about Sonder and the two of them, along with another friend, created a zine that was eventually distributed at the gallery opening. Pedos and Bohlen both submitted their individual work as well, but only Pedos’s was accepted. “Yeah, I submitted some work along with the zine, but it didn’t get accepted. It just wasn’t the mood,” Bohlen remarked. The two have submitted work to other teen-run galleries analogous to Sonder, but no established “real” galleries. “I can’t even imagine getting into an adult-run gallery, because I’m so young, and my work just doesn’t feel good enough yet. I don’t feel like my work is developed enough to be on the same level as older, more established people.” said Bohlen. The two consider gallery spaces such as Sonder less about getting their art into the world and more about practicing navigating the art world.  
Lexi Meace, 19, another artist who displayed work at Sonder, attended Sonder’s original exhibit in Brooklyn. She discovered Sonder through Instagram as well. “I think it’s pretty easy to find out about galleries and stuff through social media. I think it’s so cool to be a young artist in NYC because there’s so much here. NYC has a very large young artist community and it’s really cool.” Pedos commented on the young New York art scene as well, stating, “Its difficult to be an artist here, but it’s the best. Manhattan is the best place to live; I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.”
