			<p>She Rises Like the Sun: Invocations of the Goddess by Contemporary American Poets, first published in 1989, represents the female voice in modern-day polytheistic religion. Comprised of over one hundred poems by twenty-nine female poets, She Rises Like the Sun worships the vast concept of the Goddess through the written word. It is a reclamation of the female voice; a way to celebrate a feminine deity of the poet’s own creation, unencumbered by the patriarchy of male-dominated religion. This Goddess-centric poetry offers women an individualized, internal bridge with which to communicate with their own self-created holy being. 
Beginning with the sins of Eve, women have been continually trampled upon in monotheistic, male dominated religions such as Christianity. Oftentimes, mass organized religion has been used as a patriarchal tool of oppression, effectively trapping women beneath the rule of men. To use Christianity as an overarching example, women in the Bible are almost always described as extensions of their husbands, and are very rarely seen as beings of their own autonomy and thought. Corinthians 14:34-35 says “The women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says. If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.” Women are not allowed to be religiously active even in their own churches. They are silenced in the realm of religion, as well as in society. Genesis 2:18 states “Then the Lord God said, ‘It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him,’” implying that a woman exists only to be subservient to her husband. The Bible dictates specific behavior for women as well, demanding they be chaste, obedient, submissive, and quiet. Timothy 2:11-15 sees women only as wombs, as “transgressors” only to “be saved through childbirth.” Timothy 2:12 states “I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.” Women’s voices have continually been silenced and stolen in the Christian religion, effectively robbing women of an outward celebration of faith. 
Women’s voices have been silenced in writing as well. Although there were and are many incredible female poets and writers, for a long time their work was ridiculed, demeaned and looked down upon. Oftentimes women were forced to use male alias to publish their work. Women in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries such as The Brontë Sisters, Violet Paget, and Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin (known as George Sand) adopted male nom de plumes, and even modern women writers like J.K Rowling wrote under explicitly male or gender ambiguous names in order to better their chances at publication. When a young Charlotte Brontë sent a collection of her poems to poet laureate Robert Southey, he responded that, although she possessed great talent, “literature cannot be the business of a woman’s life, and ought not to be,” and suggested she concentrate more on the traditional “duties” as a woman. Had Brontë taken these words to heart, Jane Eyre might never have been published, and the effects of the book on countless women would never have come to fruition. Forced to conceal their gender and hide their true identities, women’s voices have not only been cut out of the male-driven religious scene but out of the similarly male-driven literary scene as well.  
The invention of the Goddess reclaims both women’s religious voice as well as their creative voice, creating a space in which the two can actively flourish. Religious poetry has always served as a means to celebrate and connect with the divine, regardless of the denomination of the poet. Religious poetry allows a worshipper to connect personally with their deity in their own voice, rather than with the pre-prescribed words of prayer. The poetry of She Rises Like the Sun attempts the same, using poetry as a tool for transcendence. The use of the word “invoke” in the subtitle of the collection refers to the calling upon of a deity. For the women writers of She Rises Like the Sun, poetry acts as a sort of telephone with which to communicate with the Goddess. This invocation seems to highlight a process of inspiration between the poet and the Goddess, as invoking often means to “call upon for help”. The women invoke their Goddess for a creative ritual: writing. This invocation calls for the rejection of monotheistic, male-centered religion in favor of female-crafted deities. 
Janine Canan, editor of She Rises like the Sun defines the Goddess as, among other things, “the light and the dark. She is the dancer, the singer, the lover, the sufferer. She is life and She is death. She is goodness and evil; the void and creation. She is us. She is all. […] She is love of life, love for the planet on which we live and love for all of the beings that live upon it.” (pg xlvi) The Goddess is many-formed and many named. The form She takes directly relates to the individual faith and ideals of the poet. The term ‘Goddess’ functions as an umbrella term, including thousands of different deities. The Goddess is not a single, divine being such as the Christian God, She is a conglomerate of female power, containing multitudes. 
 As an opened-ended concept, the Goddess allows the poet to create her own representation of the divine, emulating the ideals important to her, and is not restricted to the canon of organized religion. Some of the writers in She Rises Like the Sun use pre-existing Goddesses from a myriad of religions, such as Gaia, Kali, Persephone or Hecate. Other poets use real-life women like Sally Ride or even themselves to elevate earthly women to a divine status. And still others create their own Goddess, naming them Motherdeath, the Loba, the woman in the moon, or Winged Woman, among other titles. These Goddesses offer women a transcendence different from the transcendence of religion. The transcendence of the Goddess is a transcendence of the soul, occurring inside the woman, and raising her to a new level of internal power.   
Hera, Hung from the Sky by Carolyn Kizner takes the Greek Goddess Hera and uses her voice to write about the convoluted relationships between men and women. In traditional Greek mythology, Hera was hung from the sky by Zeus, her husband, after an attempted revolt against him. Such a punishment beat Hera into submission, and she never went against her husband again. “I pitted my feminine weight/ against God, his terrible throne,” says Kizner’s Hera as she hangs. (pg 70) Although Hera may appear a tragic tale of female submission, Kizner’s poem seeks to alert women of the systematic sexism surrounding them. The plight of Hera represents every story of a woman who has attempted to equal herself in relation to a man, and faced disturbing punishment as consequence. 
Real-life, historical women play the role of Goddess as well. Lynn Lonidier’s The Swinging Goddess – Sally Ride, First American Woman Astronaut (pg 103) casts Sally Ride as the Goddess, comparing her to the hanging of Hera, and to the biblical Eve. Levertov’s prose is rhythmic and repetitive, like the chant of a war cry or the beat of a drum circle. Her poem alludes to the mistreatment of women by men, through Hera, Eve, and through Sally Ride, who was continually discounted by men and by the world, even after accomplishing amazing things. 
Many of the poets of She Rises like the Sun created their own Goddess, naming them and molding them personally. Famed feminist poet Diane DiPrima created a sprawling mythological world through her poetry, presided over by the Loba, the wolf goddess. The Loba is a goddess of DiPrima’s own creation, a representation of the wildness inside women. The Loba rejects the societal ideas surrounding women of the 1950’s and 1960’s, instead encouraging women to be vicious, carnal, and untamed. Throughout an eight-poem cycle, DiPrima develops the Loba as a divine creature hunted by men, yet ultimately uncatchable. In Will You Hunt the Loba? DiPrima laughs at the foolishness of men attempting to reign in women, beginning the poem with the words “And will you hunt the Loba?/Fools, will you use/lance, spear or arrow, gun or/boomerang?” (pg 21) She criticizes men who destroy women for their own personal gain: “Will you make a cap/of her stomach, a necklace of her spine?” (pg 22) In other poems, she communicates directly with the Loba, instead of simply writing of her presence. In the Poet Prays to the Loba, DiPrima creates a personal prayer for her Goddess. “O/Lady fling your bright drops to us, emblems/of your love, throw/your green scarf on the battered earth once more,” she asks. (pg. 25) In The Loba Addresses the Goddess / or The Poet as Priestess Address the Loba Goddess DiPrima casts herself as a religious being in her own right. (pg. 27)  As priestess to the Loba, DiPrima gives herself in service to the Goddess as an agent of change, encouraging a self-transcendence in all women. 
Julia Vinograd creates her own Goddess as well, who carries the name Motherdeath. This name subverts the stereotype of mother as creator and instead casts her as destroyer, as death. Motherdeath rejects the idea that a woman’s highest honor is motherhood, and instead encourages women to seek their own path.  Each section of her five-part poem begins with the line “Mother is dead. Death is Mother.”  (pg.183) Each section ends with the lines “With her young face and her black hair/full of kisses,/with her old face and white hair/full of disinfectant,/with her bone face and her own hair/full of dirt.” Vinograd seems to subvert the cycle of Maiden, Mother, Crone by creating a Goddess who instead rejects the common tropes of women, and instead forms her own identity as a female grim reaper. 
Some women writers cast themselves as the Goddess instead. In Anne Waldman’s Makeup on Empty Space, Waldman transforms herself into the Goddess from nothing. “I am putting makeup on empty space” she repeats over and over again, as an incantation of the self. (pg. 200) She binds together all the things in life that bring her struggle and take them to the empty place: “I am binding my debts, I magnetize the phone bill/bind the root of my sharp pointed tongue/ […] I bind the color red I seduce the color red to the empty space […] I take the green of everything coming to life, it grows &/climbs in the empty space”. The empty space is not a terrifying void, it is a space in which to grow, create, and evolve. Anne Waldman grows herself as the Goddess there, and emerges more powerful than before. She ends the poem with the lines “It begins with the root of the tongue/it begins with the root of the heart/there is a spinal cord of wind/singing and moaning inside the empty space.” 
The poems and authors of She Rises Like the Sun: Invocations of the Goddess by Contemporary American Woman Poets create a new idea of religion in which women are brought to the forefront rather than shoved to the back. She Rises Like the Sun does not entertain the patriarchal standards of the religious and literary world. It instead rejects the stereotypes cast upon women for centuries, and opens up a world within which women are actively encouraged to vocalize their faith through poetry. By writing poetry about the Goddess, women are given a space within which to find self-transcendence and communicate with the divine.
